Water Level Monitoring and Alert System
📌 Project Overview

This project is an Arduino-based Water Level Monitoring and Alert System. It continuously monitors the water level in a tank using an ultrasonic sensor, displays the water level on a 16×2 LCD, and activates a buzzer alert when the tank is almost full.
A potentiometer is used to adjust the LCD contrast, ensuring the display is clear and readable.
